# Security Audit & Implementation Report

## ✅ Completed Security Fixes (High Priority)

### 1. Webhook Idempotency (HIGH) - FIXED
**Issue**: Stripe/PayPal webhooks can retry; duplicate purchases possible without deduplication.

**Implemented Fixes**:
- ✅ Unique index on `purchases(provider, provider_id)` prevents duplicate records
- ✅ Webhook handlers catch duplicate key errors (code 23505) and return 200 OK
- ✅ Server-side price validation: fetches product price from DB, validates against Stripe amount
- ✅ Logs price mismatches for audit without blocking legitimate payments
- ✅ All webhook retries are now idempotent

**Code Location**:
- Migration: `supabase/migrations/*_webhook_idempotency_and_indexes.sql`
- Handler: `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts` lines 93-122

**Testing**:
```bash
# Replay same webhook event multiple times
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook \
  -H "stripe-signature: $SIG" \
  -d "$EVENT_JSON"

# Expected: First call creates purchase, subsequent calls return 200 with no new record
```

### 2. Download Security (MEDIUM) - FIXED
**Issue**: Potential for directory traversal, memory exhaustion, incorrect MIME types.

**Implemented Fixes**:
- ✅ Path traversal protection: validates no `..` or absolute paths
- ✅ File size limit: 50MB maximum to prevent memory exhaustion
- ✅ Content-Type mapping: proper MIME types based on file extension
- ✅ Security headers: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- ✅ Access control: validates purchase before any file operations

**Code Location**: `app/api/marketplace/download/[slug]/route.ts` lines 40-84

**Validated Extensions**:
- `.pdf`, `.epub`, `.zip`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.txt`, `.md`
- All others default to `application/octet-stream`

---

### 3. Performance Indexes (MEDIUM) - FIXED
**Issue**: Hot query paths unoptimized, could cause slow page loads under traffic.

**Implemented Indexes**:
- ✅ `products_published_created_idx`: Published products listing
- ✅ `products_type_published_idx`: Category filtering
- ✅ `purchases_user_created_idx`: User purchase history
- ✅ `purchases_user_product_status_idx`: Access check optimization
- ✅ `series_items_series_order_idx`: Series content ordering
- ✅ `purchases_provider_subscription_idx`: Subscription updates
- ✅ `purchases_provider_status_idx`: Refund processing

**Impact**: Reduces query time from O(n) to O(log n) for critical paths.

---

### 4. Health Check Endpoint (LOW) - FIXED
**Issue**: No observability for production health monitoring.

**Implemented**:
- ✅ `/api/health` endpoint returns JSON health status
- ✅ Tests database connectivity with lightweight query
- ✅ Returns 200 (healthy) or 503 (degraded)
- ✅ Includes response times, uptime, version info

**Testing**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T...",
  "services": {
    "database": { "status": "healthy", "responseTime": "45ms" },
    "api": { "status": "healthy" }
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Existing Security Features (Already Implemented)

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ All tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ Restrictive default: no access without explicit policy
- ✅ Users can only view their own purchases
- ✅ Service role used only in Edge Functions (never client-side)
- ✅ Public can view published products only

### Webhook Signature Verification
- ✅ Stripe: Uses `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` with signature validation
- ✅ Returns 400 on invalid signatures
- ✅ PayPal: Basic webhook handling (upgrade to full signature validation recommended)

### Authentication
- ✅ Supabase Auth with email/password
- ✅ JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (not accessible to client JS)
- ✅ Session management handled by Supabase SDK

### Payment Security
- ✅ All payment processing in Edge Functions (API keys never exposed to client)
- ✅ Stripe/PayPal credentials in environment variables only
- ✅ Customer email validated before purchase creation

---

## ⚠️ Recommended Future Enhancements

### 1. PayPal Webhook Signature Verification (MEDIUM Priority)
**Current State**: PayPal webhooks accepted without signature validation.

**Recommendation**:
```typescript
// Add to paypal-webhook Edge Function
import crypto from "node:crypto";

const webhookId = Deno.env.get("PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID");
const transmissionId = req.headers.get("paypal-transmission-id");
const transmissionSig = req.headers.get("paypal-transmission-sig");
const transmissionTime = req.headers.get("paypal-transmission-time");

// Verify signature using PayPal SDK or manual crypto verification
```

### 2. Rate Limiting (MEDIUM Priority)
**Recommendation**: Add rate limiting to public endpoints:
- `/api/marketplace/checkout` - 10 requests/minute per user
- `/api/health` - 100 requests/minute per IP
- Edge Functions - Use Supabase built-in rate limiting

### 3. Audit Logging (LOW Priority)
**Recommendation**: Log critical events for forensics:
- Purchase creations (already logged via database)
- Failed authentication attempts
- Webhook failures
- File download attempts (especially failed access attempts)

### 4. Content Security Policy (LOW Priority)
**Recommendation**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS:
```typescript
// In middleware.ts
'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; ..."
```

### 5. Coupon System Security (If Implemented)
**Recommendations**:
- Validate `active = true AND expires_at > now()` in Edge Function
- Add unique constraint on `code` if single-use coupons
- Track coupon usage to prevent abuse
- Consider max usage limits per coupon

## 🧪 Security Testing Checklist

### Pre-Production Tests

**Webhook Tests**:
- [ ] Replay same Stripe event 3 times → expect 1 purchase record
- [ ] Send webhook with tampered amount → expect warning logged
- [ ] Send webhook with invalid signature → expect 400 response
- [ ] Send webhook for non-existent product → expect 400 response

**Access Control Tests**:
- [ ] Non-authenticated user tries to download → expect 403
- [ ] User without purchase tries to download → expect 403
- [ ] User with valid purchase downloads → expect file
- [ ] User tries path traversal (`../../etc/passwd`) → expect 400

**RLS Tests** (use different user JWTs):
- [ ] User A cannot see User B's purchases
- [ ] User cannot update their own purchase status
- [ ] Anonymous user can view published products only
- [ ] Anonymous user cannot view unpublished products

**Performance Tests**:
- [ ] Load `/market` with 1000+ products → expect <2s response
- [ ] Load user purchase history with 100+ purchases → expect <1s
- [ ] Health check responds within 100ms
